Origamic Architecture Pop-Up Card Making Guide
==============================================

These instructions describe the process of making a pair of 13 cm x 9 cm
pop-ups, but it should be reasonably straightforward to apply the method to
origamic architecture based pop-ups in general.

For more information (and some pictures), see <http://cridge.co/1KzvkOd>.



Things you'll need
------------------

The following will make *one pair* of pop-ups complete with envelopes.


Materials:

- 1 sheet of card for the pop-ups (A4, 160 gsm)
- 1 sheet of card backings (A4, 160 gsm)
- 2 sheets of paper for the envelopes (A4, 80 gsm)


Tools:

- Craft knife
- Steel-edged rule
- Self-healing cutting mat
- An old ballpoint pen (for scoring)
- Glue pen, PVA glue, or double-sided tape
- A4 printer



Pop-up basics
-------------

Here are a few things you'll need to know before you can start making your
pop-up.


Scoring:

  Scoring helps you make folds neatly and in the right places. You can score
  fold lines using the back of a craft knife or by applying pressure with an
  old ballpoint pen. The latter method is often better because it compresses
  (rather than removes) material along the fold line, which avoids weakening
  the model.

  You can either score all fold lines on the same side of the material, or you
  can score each line individually on the side of the material where it will
  be a valley fold. The second method takes longer but can make folding the
  model easier later on.


Cutting:

  Cut lines are marked on the templates in *solid black*. You can cut along
  the lines in any order, though there is often a way to approach the cutting
  which will make things easier.

  Try cutting out any small islands first -- eyes, windows, et cetera. Next
  cut along any curves and fine sections, such as where there are many cut
  lines close together. Beginning with these cuts minimises the stress felt by
  the material in areas where it is weakest, and when a rule is not being used
  to distribute the tension from the knife.

  Making the remaining cuts with a steel rule is then straightforward.


Folding:

  Folding is perhaps the most difficult step in assembling your pop-up, but
  should not be too much trouble provided you have scored all the fold lines.
  There are two types of fold -- mountain and valley. Mountain folds are
  marked by *orange* lines while valley folds are in *light blue*; the names
  reflect the way that the folds look when you have the page printed-side up.

  Making the folds in this way will mean that the printed side of the material
  becomes the back of the model, so that all of the fold lines and markings
  will be hidden in the finished pop-up.

  Begin folding the model by pinching along each of the fold lines so that
  they bend in the right direction; avoid causing the nearby material to curve
  where possible. You can then tease the model into its open position, where
  all the folds form right angles. This is most easily achieved by repeatedly
  working through all of the folds from left to right, ensuring that they are
  always all at similar levels.

  Getting the model to its closed position is a simple continuation of this
  process: slowly squash the model, starting at the spine and making sure that
  the only bending is at the fold lines. Ensure that all of the 'steps' are
  pulled out to their fullest extent as the model flattens, and use your thumb
  to reinforce the final folds.


Glueing:

  The final step in the assembly of your pop-up is to glue the separate pieces
  together. This is generally relatively straightforward but there are a few
  things worth noting.

  First, don't use too much glue! Glue contains moisture and so can cause your
  model to warp and bubble up -- the less you can get away with, the better.
  Glue pens are good here as they are drier and slower setting in air than
  PVA, though the bond isn't as strong. You can avoid glue altogether and use
  double-sided tape, but bear in mind that tape is very difficult to adjust
  once you've made contact, and can look unsightly if it's too thick.

  The best way to glue a pop-up model to its backing is to apply your chosen
  adhesive in a thin line all around the perimeter of the printed side;
  suggested glue areas are *shaded in grey* on the templates (you can also add
  extra lines of adhesive within the perimeter if necessary). Make the contact
  while the pop-up model and backing are in the open (right angled)
  position -- the most important part to align correctly is the spine, since
  you can trim the border later if necessary. Be sure to apply pressure using
  your fingers to all of the glue areas to get a good bond, and give the glue
  time to set in the open position before you close the finished pop-up for
  the first time.


General hints and tips:

  If you're trying to make a complicated model, it can often help to make a
  rough version using 80 gsm paper first -- there's no need to cut out all the
  details at this point, just get an idea of how it will fold. It can also be
  helpful to practise on a model at double scale.



Assembly instructions
---------------------

The following will guide you through the process of making a pair of pop-ups
and accompanying envelopes.


Printing templates:

  For each pair of pop-ups you intend to make, you will need to print the
  following templates:

  - 1 'small card' template on coloured card
  - 1 'small card backing' template on another colour of card
  - 2 'small envelope' templates on coloured paper

  The templates are designed to fit on a sheet of A4 when printed at 100%,
  though some printers may impose large borders and clip the edges; if this
  occurs, try selecting 'borderless' in the print options or reduce the print
  scale slightly. As long as you print all of the templates at the same scale,
  it does not matter which scale you choose.


Making the interior:

  The 'small card' template contains two pop-up interiors as well as emblems
  to go on the front of the finished pop-ups.

  Score, cut and fold the two interiors using the instructions in the previous
  section. It is generally best to score all of the fold lines before you make
  any cuts to avoid snagging the material.

  Cut out the two emblems for use later.


Attaching the backing:

  The 'small card backing' template contains markings to help you cut a pair
  of backings for your pop-ups. Since the edges of the backing will be visible
  from both sides, the actual cut and fold lines have not been printed;
  instead, registration marks indicating the outer border and position of the
  spine are provided. Hopefully the 'filled-in' diagram below will clarify the
  meaning of these marks.

               __| _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ |__
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
                 :                     :                     :
               __: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ :__
                 |                     |                     |


  Score and cut as above to make the backings. Since the template is printed
  on black, the marks will appear very faint -- it may be useful to go over
  them first with a soft pencil so that they are more easily visible.

  You can then glue the interiors to the backings as in the previous section.
  After allowing the glue time to set, attach one of the emblems to the front
  of each pop-up using your chosen adhesive.


Making the envelopes:

  The envelopes are constructed from the 'small envelope' template.

  The fold lines are the four lines which form the rectangle within the
  envelope outline. They are printed in light grey so that they are
  unnoticeable in the finished envelope, though they should be valley folds.
  The darker lines that form the perimeter are the cut lines.

  The envelopes are fairly straightforward to assemble -- simply score, cut
  and fold as above and then apply adhesive as necessary to attach the two
  side tabs to the large bottom flap. It is best to cut the angled sides of
  the flaps from the inside outwards to avoid nicking the corners of the
  envelope.

  You can seal the envelopes with glue, single- or double-sided tape, or with
  gift spots if you have them.


Done!
