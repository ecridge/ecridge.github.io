  Some instructions and templates for making origamic architecture based
  pop-up cards.

![Lego brick pop-up cards](/content/jpg/lego-brick-cards.jpg)

A few years ago I started selling [origamic architecture][OA] based pop-up
cards on Etsy. I don&rsquo;t make them much any more (I&rsquo;m currently busy
with other things), but recently I&rsquo;ve had quite a few requests for
instructions and templates for the cards I used to sell.

It&rsquo;s unlikely that I&rsquo;ll be selling cards again any time soon, so I
figured I might as well post the templates that I have to hand on here so that
anyone who&rsquo;s interested can have a go at making some themselves.

<!--fold-->

I&rsquo;ll try to add some more when I get the chance.

## General instructions

Below are two instruction booklets that I used to have on my Etsy shop.[^1]
They&rsquo;re both fairly similar (the process is the same for all the cards),
so if you flick through one of them you should find all the information you
need to get going.

- [Lego brick card instructions](/content/pdf/lego-brick-instructions.pdf)
- [Minecraft creeper card instructions](/content/pdf/minecraft-creeper-instructions.pdf)

Don&rsquo;t be put off by the template numbers -- if it starts with S,
you&rsquo;ll find it under the [small cards](#small-cards) section; L templates
are [large cards](#large-cards); and E and B templates (envelopes and backings
for mounting) are at the bottom under [stationery](#stationery).

## Small cards

![Small pop-up cards](/content/jpg/small-cards.jpg)

These cards are 13&nbsp;cm &times; 9&nbsp;cm when closed. You can make two
from a single sheet of A4, though you will need a second sheet for the
backings if you intend to mount them.

## Large cards

These cards are 17.5&nbsp;cm &times; 13&nbsp;cm when closed. They each require
one sheet of A4 (as do the backings).
